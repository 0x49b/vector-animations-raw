Maya rigs, scenes, and other resources for the Vector Robot!  

Sincere thanks to [Randall Maas](https://github.com/randym32) for his generous contributions to the OSKR project and to the Vector community!  

Building new animations requires a license to [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR). Once you have installed Maya, you will need to install the AnkiMenu plugin (see the [AnkiMenu readme](https://github.com/digital-dream-labs/vector-animations-raw/blob/main/assets/tools/plugins/readme.txt)). Once that is done, please see the [documentation](https://github.com/digital-dream-labs/vector-animations-raw/tree/main/documentation) folder for build guidelines.
